        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p><strong>PathLight</strong> is a discipleship journey designed to help you grow in your relationship with Jesus Christ by walking in the light of His truth. It draws inspiration from Psalm 119:105 — <em>“Your word is a lamp to my feet, and a light to my path.”</em></p>
        <p>This workbook will guide you step by step to understand who Jesus is, what it means to follow Him, and how to live a life that honors God. As part of this journey, you will learn important truths from the Bible (doctrine), enrich your prayer life, discover your identity in Christ, grow in God's character, and serve others with your gifts.</p>
        <p>PathLight is for anyone beginning or deepening their faith journey. You will gather in sessions, reflect on Scripture, and participate in activities that strengthen your faith community and your personal walk with God.</p>
        <p><strong>LIT TO LEAD. ROOTED TO GROW.</strong></p>

        <h2>Strategic Plan</h2>
        <p>The Strategic Plan for CY Ministry is a framework to raise young people in the way of Jesus through four key pillars: <strong>Evangelism, Discipleship, Life Skills, and Leadership Development.</strong> It helps refocus efforts toward intentional spiritual growth and purpose-driven ministry.</p>
        <p>Our mission is to redirect young people back to their Creator amidst distractions of modern life and spread the Gospel to all ages. The four pillars form the foundation of the CY Ministry strategy, guiding all actions toward our ultimate purpose — Christ-centered transformation.</p>
